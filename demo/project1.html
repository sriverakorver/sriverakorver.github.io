    This series was captured along a hiking trail on the Big Island of Hawaii, a path renowned for its stunning waterfallsâ€”and its accessible dumping ground. Scattered along the trail, four decaying cars are clearly visible, with countless more hidden within the dense jungle brush. This juxtaposition raises important questions: the ethics of leaving waste in nature, the implications of photographing discarded remnants in a way that highlights their beauty rather than their destruction, the socioeconomic factors that drive locals to abandon their vehicles instead of disposing of them legally, and the responsibility of using photography to address environmental pollution. As you explore this series, I invite you to reflect on these complexities and consider the multiple perspectives they present.
